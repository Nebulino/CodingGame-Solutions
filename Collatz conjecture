The Collatz conjecture is a opened mathematics problem. Given a number N, the repetition of this operation will always eventually reach the loop 1 ⇒ 4 ⇒2 ⇒1 ...
* If N is even, N becomes N/2
* If N is odd, N becomes 3*N+1

Can you try it with this numbers and print the number of steps to reach 1?

n=int(input())
s=0
while n!=1: n=n/2 if n%2==0 else 3*n+1;s+=1;
print(s)
